Website dedicated for the tree walk(s) of CSU Fresno campus

Source code of [CSU Fresno Tree Walk website](https://TreeWalks.github.io).
A new tree walk of the campus was designed to primarily include native, indigenous, and / or drought resistant specimen. This website shows the newly designed stops along with 360 photos and a companion augmented reality guide application.

## Companion app accompanies website

This is also a companion website to an [Augmented Reality Treet Walk application (also open source)](https://github.com/TreeWalks/tree-walk-guide/). The applications starts off with an initial path but updates it to apply any correction made since the last app release. This way the app is operational in off-line setting, but also separated the GPS data and other information from the app so it can be corrected without an app release.

## Spinning out your own walk

You can easily spin out your own walk. You just need to modify the GPS locations and possibly the artwork in case your walk is not a tree walk but a different kind.
1. Each stop along the path is technically a Jekyll blog post. You want to modify the blog posts, reorder them, insert or delete.
2. Possibly feature extra or different meta data. The trees will have their latin names, short description and even a link to their wikipedia page.
3. Design different logos (or you could keep ours): this includes the website logo, application logo, map marker logos.
4. Possibly redesign the 3D augmented markers and objects. Currently I'm using a combination of CAD objects models with runtime assmebled object factory compound objects.

Everything is open source so feel free to modify as you wish! Contact us if you have any questions!
