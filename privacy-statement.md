  <h5>Personal information collection</h5>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      The application does not permanently store any personal information.
      Libraries used by the application indirectly ephemerally process camera and location information,
      see about that later.

  <h5>Securing your data</h5>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      The application uses standard methods and APIs to provide augmented reality experience.
      The functionality is provided by Google's ARCore technology together with Google Maps technology.
      These libraries ephemerally process your data for the sake of generating the Augmented Reality
      experience, but these data are not stored permanently or transferred. Processing happen under the hood
      (and only ephemerally) so securing is not applicable.

<div class="section">
  <h5>Cross-border data transfers</h5>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      The application doesn't transmit any data to the knowledge of the author. ARCore and Google Maps
      libraries may query extra information (such as Street View 360 photos) to help with orientation
      processing and more precise location and elevation, however these are all incoming data.

<div class="section">
  <h5>Permissions</h5>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      The camera permission is needed because that's essential for augmented reality experience,
      and as such it's needed for the Augmented Reality engine (ARCore).
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      Constant camera video stream is necessary to provide the actual reality part of the
      augmented reality experience. ARCore also uses that to continuously correct orinetation drift
      and the placement of the map pins.

  <div class="row">

      The app doesn't contain any advertisement framework and does not require any authentication either.

  <h5>Terms of Service</h5>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      The creator is not responsible for any damage or loss caused by the app.
      Augmented reality experience requires constant video stream processing and 3D geometry calculations.
      This may cause the device to heat up while being used.
